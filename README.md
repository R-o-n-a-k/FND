## 🚀 About Project

**Fake News Detection App** is a machine learning-powered web application that determines whether a news article is real or fake. Built using Python Flask for the backend and a UI layer, it leverages both **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** and **Naive Bayes** algorithms for classification. The model is trained using a Kaggle-sourced dataset and integrated into a minimal, responsive interface for ease of use and rapid testing.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

-  **ML Models:** Passive Aggressive Classifier, Naive Bayes
-  **Backend:** Python, Flask
-  **ML Tools:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
-  **Dataset:** [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
-  **Frontend/UI:** HTML, CSS (basic Flask templates)
-  **Deployment:** Render

## ✨ Features

- ML-based fake vs real news classification
- Real-time prediction on custom input
- Trained on large dataset from Kaggle
- Model with highest accuracy gets connected (Naive Bayes / Passive Aggressive)
- Flask-powered backend with Python model integration
- Minimal UI for testing predictions
